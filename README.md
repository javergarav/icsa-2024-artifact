## Artifact Details

### Name

Sarch-Knows: Knowledge Graph for Supporting Sarch-Checks Method.

### Abstract

Sarch-knows is a knowledge graph presented in the paper, required for the checking process of the proposed install/. The artifact presented to ICSA corresponds to a compact version of this knowledge graph.

### Overview

In order to interact with Sarch-Knows, it is necessary to recognize the way as the Neo4j client works. Thus, general aspects are described below:

**1.** Finish the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) guide.

**2.** Recognize the Neo4j client dashboard:

**Notation:**

1. sdfsdf
2. fgfgdfg

### Examples

Some examples that can be executed, using the Cypher language in the Neo4j client, are described in [Test Cases](TEST_CASES.md).
